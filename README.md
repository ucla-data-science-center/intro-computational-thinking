This lesson was ported from Belinda Weaver's [Intro to Computational Thinking](https://github.com/weaverbel/intro-computational-thinking).
Her original lesson can be found in the link and this lesson is her lesson but in the Carpentries format. This is her [github](https://github.com/weaverbel)

## Topic and aims

An introduction to computational thinking

Once you have completed this workshop, you should be able to:

- Identify the steps involved in computational thinking
- Break a problem down into more manageable pieces
- Develop an algorithm (a series of steps) to solve the problem
- Use abstraction (generalising a solution) to make the algorithm re-usable

The workshop will not teach computer programming *per se*. Instead it will cover the thought processes involved should you want to learn to program.

## Audience

This workshop is aimed at librarians and researchers at all stages who want to understand the building blocks of computational thinking.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this workshop you will need: 

- A pen and paper

## Assumed knowledge

No prior knowledge is assumed. 


## Why?

Rather than making slides for a workshop, why not make a website? 
It's easier to write, access, share, and reuse. 
GitHub and GitHub Pages makes this pretty easy.

It is a better Open Educational Resource since anyone can make a copy and adapt!
