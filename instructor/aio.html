<p>Computational thinking is an essential prerequisite for anyone
wanting to learn to program computers and write code.</p>
<p>Different definitions of computational thinking exist. However,
computational thinking can be described as a set of strategies to enable
people to solve problems, especially complex ones. The BBC provides a
good definition:</p>
<p><em>“Computers can be used to help us solve problems. However, before
a problem can be tackled, the problem itself and the ways in which it
could be solved need to be understood. Computational thinking … allows
us to take a complex problem, understand what the problem is and develop
possible solutions. We can then present these solutions in a way that a
computer, a human, or both, can understand.”</em></p>

</h4>
<p>Four friends are out on an afternoon walk through a forest. Their
plan was to go only for a short hike, so no-one has brought along an
emergency beacon, and all mobile phones were left in the car. Everyone
has a water bottle, though these are no longer full, but no-one brought
a map as the trail they were planning to follow is clearly marked and
signposted.</p>
<p>However, they all left the trail together in a great rush when they
heard a distant cry for help. After some fast walking through dense
woods trying and failing to reach whoever made that distress call, they
realise quite suddenly that they are lost. The cries sound much more
distant now, but when they retrace their steps to what they thought was
the path to strike out in a different direction, they cannot find
it.</p>
<p>The sun is starting to sink, it is growing colder, they are now
hopelessly lost, and everyone is starting to feel hungry …</p>
<p><em>So what do they do?</em></p>

<p>This is a complex problem. As we progress through this lesson, we
will learn how to break this problem down so that we can start to solve
it. Let’s first come to grips with what computational thinking is.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/comp-think.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="The four components of computational thinking" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The four components of computational
thinking</div>
</figure><p>There are four essential components of computational thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Decomposition</strong> – breaking a problem down into more
manageable parts so that solutions can be found for each. This is also
called <em>factoring</em>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pattern recognition</strong> – looking for similarities
within a problem or with other problems so that past solutions or
knowledge can be re-used</li>
<li>
<strong>Algorithms</strong> – developing step-by-step solutions to
each part of the problem</li>
<li>
<strong>Abstraction</strong> – generalising (abstracting) the
important detail to make a solution reusable</li>
</ul>

<p>Professor Jeannette Wing raised computational thinking as an
important issue for researchers in a 2006 paper. She stated,
<em>“Informally, computational thinking describes the mental activity in
formulating a problem to admit a computational solution. The solution
can be carried out by a human or machine, or more generally, by
combinations of humans and machines.”</em></p>
<figure><img src="../fig/brains.png" style="width:40.0%" alt="brain" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Wing believes that computational thinking is just as important a
skill for school children to learn as reading, writing and arithmetic.
Increasingly, schools are including computational thinking in school
curricula.</p>

<p>While automation brings many benefits, such as lightning-fast data
capture and analysis, it can also render decisions and analysis opaque
and overly rigid. The famous phrase <em>‘Computer says no’</em> from the
TV show <em>Little Britain</em> is a perfect example of this kind of
intransigence. Experiences of this kind will frustrate users.</p>
<p>Algorithms have also been criticised for bias. As Karan Praharaj <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-are-algorithms-biased-8449406aaa83" class="external-link">says</a>:
<em>“Algorithms do what they’re taught. Unfortunately, some are
inadvertently taught prejudices and unethical biases by societal
patterns hidden in the data … When these algorithms do the job of
amplifying racial, social and gender inequality, instead of alleviating
it; it becomes necessary to take stock of the ethical ramifications and
potential malevolence of the technology.”</em></p>
<p>Use automation, but use it wisely, and ethically, and always with
lashings of human oversight.</p>

<p>Our friends in the forest are still in the shouting, blaming and
squabbling stage of their predicament, so while they are occupied in
<strong>NOT</strong> solving their problem, we will look at
computational thinking in a little more detail and examine how we can
use each step to solve a maths problem.</p>

<p>In this exercise, we will see how computational thinking can be used
to add up all the numbers between 1 and 200 in our heads,
i.e. <code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4</code> and so on. We should be able to do this
in less than a minute.</p>
<p>Seems impossible?</p>
<p>It’s not.</p>

<p>Computers are precise, and computing instructions must be clear and

Unlike humans, computers do not get bored or distracted, they process
data very quickly, and will carry out the same tedious, repetitive tasks
over and over again without making mistakes.</p>

<p>Subconsciously, we practise computational thinking every day of our
lives. As Jeannette Wing stated:</p>
<p><em>“Computational thinking describes the mental activity in
formulating a problem to admit a computational solution. <strong>The
solution can be carried out by a human or machine</strong>.”</em></p>
<p>Every time we need to plan to do something, we use some of the steps
of computational thinking such as problem breakdown, pattern recognition
and developing algorithms.</p>

<li><p>Project managers use computational thinking to plan complex
activities such as building a tunnel or revamping a playground.</p></li>

<p><em>Decomposition</em> is crucial in any kind of problem breakdown,
but especially so in programming. The computer must be told
<strong>precisely</strong> what to do, and in what order, so problems
must be broken down into discrete parts and each section coded
appropriately.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to find the ten words most commonly used in a text.
How might we go about that?</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="linear-code">Linear code<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#linear-code"></a>
</h4>
<p>While there are many different ways to do this task, this is one way,
where all the commands are run in a linear sequence, e.g.,</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/count-words.png" style="width:60.0%" alt="counting words in a text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Counting words in a text</div>
</figure><p>First we save the file in <code>.txt</code> format to eliminate all
the “smart” formatting created by programs like Word (as they would
otherwise introduce a messy bunch of extraneous characters). Then we
progressively eliminate everything from the text that is not a word,
i.e. punctuation.</p>
<p>Converting all the words to lower case means we end up with a single
version of each word - not two. This is important because, to a
computer, <code>Word</code> (starting with an upper case letter) does
not equal <code>word</code> (starting with a lower case letter) - it
treats them as two separate entities.</p>
<p>By replacing spaces with <code>new line</code> characters, each word
will end up on its own line, which makes them easy to sort
alphabetically and then count.</p>
<p>Each part of the sequence would need to be individually programmed.
Fortunately, programmers can adapt code that others have already used to
do similar tasks, such as code to identify letter, number or word
frequency. Once you are coding, this is where the computational thinking
skill of <em>pattern recognition</em> comes in - identifying similar
code that can be used for or adapted to the specific problem you want to
solve.</p>

<h4 id="branching-code">Branching code<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#branching-code"></a>

<p>Programming rarely works in such a linear fashion. Code generally
includes branching so that different pathways can be taken, depending on
whether or not certain conditions are met, e.g., different responses to
a <code>Yes/No</code> or <code>True/False</code> decision, as in the
example here.</p>

<p>Regardless of programming language, <strong>pseudocode</strong> is a
useful tool to break coding problems down. Pseudocode helps you list
each step of a planned process so your steps are in a logical order
before you code.</p>
<p>Pseudocode is also a good way to explain your needs to software
developers or to run your ideas past people who may not be
programmers.</p>

<p>Suppose we are fans of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> novels, but we
wonder how much the female character of Galadriel featured in the story
compared to the male characters Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and
Boromir. We could flick through, say, <em>The Fellowship of the
Ring</em> to check (which would be painfully slow), or we could run a
short piece of code to count the number of times each character’s name
is mentioned throughout the story. We could document those steps in
pseudocode before writing any code to be sure we have covered all the
things we will need to do.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/pseudo-example.png" style="width:65.0%" alt="Pseudocode steps" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Pseudocode steps</div>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishsinhaiitr/lord-of-the-rings-text" class="external-link">text
only version</a> of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> is the file the
code will process.<br>
</li>
<li>The characters’ names, Galadriel, Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas
and Boromir are the values the program will look for and count.</li>
<li>A <code>.txt</code> file is important for this kind of activity, as
all the “smart” formatting (i.e. curly quote marks, hyphens converted to
<code>em</code> and <code>en</code> dashes) that appear within a
<code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code> file is stripped out when saving
a <code>.doc</code> or <code>.docx</code> file as a <code>.txt</code>
file.</li>
<li>We could re-use the code to run a similar operation on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishsinhaiitr/lord-of-the-rings-text?select=02+-+The+Two+Towers.txt" class="external-link"><em>The

Return Of The King</em></a>, or we could adapt the code even further for
any name or word frequency question we want to automate.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><em>Spoiler alert</em> - Galadriel gets only <strong>35</strong>
mentions by name compared to Frodo’s <strong>944</strong>.</p>

</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="loops">Loops<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#loops"></a>
</h4>
<p>The code that will be used to do this job is an example of a
<strong>loop</strong>. Loops allow us to execute the same command over
and over again until a certain pre-set condition has been met. In this
case, the condition is to have counted all the appearances of each name
on a designated list.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/loop-diagram.png" style="width:65.0%" alt="How loops work" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Loops in programming</div>
</figure><p>In the example above, the program will search all the way through the
text of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishsinhaiitr/lord-of-the-rings-text" class="external-link"><em>The
Fellowship of the Ring</em></a>, adding up all the appearances of the
first value in the list (<code>Galadriel</code>). Then it will go
through the text again to do the count for the second value
(<code>Frodo</code>). The same process will then be done for all the
other characters respectively, and then the program will report its
findings for each value. It will then stop running because the list of
names has been exhausted, i.e. the condition has been met.</p>
<p>The name values can also be called <em>variables</em>, because the
value will vary each time the loop runs through the text. Variables are
an important part of <code>abstraction</code>.</p>
<p>The same piece of code could be re-used for any word counting
exercise by changing the list variables and the input source. That would
be another example of <code>abstraction</code>.</p>

<code>.pdf</code>, <code>.jpg</code>, <code>.doc</code>, so that anyone

this automation is a complex operation that cannot be undone, we want to
make sure we don’t make those kinds of mistakes again.</p>
<p>One way to do that is to check we have coded the workflow correctly
<em>before</em> we finally execute the automation. Therefore we could
introduce a step that mimics what would happen if we executed the script
on the files, perhaps by printing the filenames we want to move or
delete to the screen (or to a file) rather than <em>actually</em>
deleting or moving them. That way we can check we are working on the
correct files and only execute the final move workflow once we are sure
we have everything right.</p>

combined weekly into a single file. It is important that each device ID
is listed within a column in the combined data file to identify all the

<p>In order to analyse the data over time, you need to append the weekly
file digest to the existing, now very large, main data file. Before
adding anything new, and in order to safeguard the integrity of the
data, you need to create a backup of that main data file and send a copy
of that backup file to your cloud storage account for safekeeping. Once
the new data has been appended, you need to rename the new main data
file with today’s date as part of the file name, and run software
against the file to ensure the integrity of the data, e.g., to check
that no data is missing (which might indicate a malfunctioning

<p>In a folder, we have 250 image files for which we want to create
backup copies before we process the images for archiving. Manually
creating 250 copies of files seems like a very boring thing to do, so we
are going to automate the workflow to create the backup copies.</p>
<p>This is a perfect task for a loop, as the task is simple and
repetitive.</p>

<p>In the code example above, the loop will run through the folder
creating back up copies of all the files with the file extension
<code>.jpg</code>. As each file is copied, each original filename and
the filename of each new file will be printed to the screen.</p>
<p>Then the loop will restart and repeat the process for all the files
with the file extension <code>.tif</code>, again printing the original
filenames and the filenames of the new files to the screen.</p>
<p>Then the loop will restart and run through the folder a third time,
creating back up copies of all the files with the file extension
<code>.png</code>, again printing the original filenames and the
filenames of the new files to the screen.</p>
<p>The loop will then stop, as there are no more variables to work
on.</p>

<p>We have a large folder of files left over from a project that is now
finished. The files are all sitting in the one folder which makes it
hard to navigate. We want to archive the project and its files, but in
the process, we want to create folders by file type, e.g.,
<code>.pdf</code>, <code>.jpg</code>, <code>.doc</code>, so that anyone
wanting to access those particular file types can do so easily. We also
want to delete files that have no file extensions. New folders will need
to be created and the different files moved into them by file type.</p>

the main folder.</li>

<p><em>Using a shell script to automate the work</em></p>
<p>The task above could be fully automated using a shell script. A shell
script is a text file containing a sequence of commands for a UNIX-based
operating system that allows those commands to be run in one go, rather
than by entering each command one at a time. Scripts make task
automation possible. The script would contain the commands to do the
tasks listed above, such as folder creation, file movement using loops,
file deletion and so on. The benefit of shell scripts is that the code
they contain can be re-used or adapted for similar tasks.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>In the process of doing the above, we actually made a few blunders.
We accidentally deleted some files we should have kept either because
they were missing a file extension. Because this automation is a complex
operation that cannot be undone, we want to make sure we don’t make
those kinds of mistakes again.</p>
<p>One way to do that is to check we have coded the workflow correctly
<em>before</em> we finally execute the automation, possibly by simply
printing to screen all the relevant filenames prior to moving them -
that way, it is possible to check we are working on the right files
before any action is taken.</p>
<p>To prevent accidental deletion of files, we could introduce a step to
check whether or not to delete a file, e.g., by using the remove command
<code>rm</code> in the Unix shell with an <code>-i</code> flag. The
<code>-i</code> flag forces the system to ask for confirmation on
whether or not to delete a file. One can answer either
<strong>Y</strong> or <strong>N</strong> to the example below.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a number of acoustic listening devices set up in the
forest. Every day, you receive an email from each device with an
attached data file recording that day’s activity. In order to analyse
the data from the devices, all the separate daily data files need to be
combined weekly into a single file. It is important that each device ID
is listed within a column in the combined data file to identify all the
different locations.</p>

<div id="accordionSolution3" class="accordion challenge-accordion accordion-flush">

</button>
<div id="collapseSolution3" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingSolution3" data-bs-parent="#accordionSolution3">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>In order to analyse the data over time, you need to append the weekly
file digest to the existing, now very large, main data file. Before
adding anything new, and in order to safeguard the integrity of the
data, you need to create a backup of that main data file and send a copy
of that backup file to your cloud storage account for safekeeping. Once
the new data has been appended, you need to rename the new main data
file with today’s date as part of the file name, and run software
against the file to ensure the integrity of the data, e.g., to check
that no data is missing (which might indicate a malfunctioning
device).</p>
<p><em>Steps in the data combination process</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a new copy of the main data file with today’s date as part of
the file name.</li>
<li>Move the previous version of the main data file to cloud
storage.</li>
<li>Save all the new data files individually to local storage with the
device ID of each as part of the file names.</li>
<li>Create a new weekly data file digest into which the daily digests
from the different devices will be imported.</li>
<li>Import each daily digest to that data file with an
<code>append</code> command, ensuring that the device ID relating to
each file’s data is written into a separate column.</li>
<li>Append the weekly digest to the newly renamed main data file.</li>
<li>Verify that no data is missing. In <a href="https://openrefine.org/" class="external-link">OpenRefine</a>, using
<code>Facet by Blank</code> on the relevant data fields could be one way
to verify that no data is missing.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Using a shell script to automate the work</em></p>
<p>Again, a shell script could be used to automate this work. Given that
these tasks are run weekly, it would make sense to turn this into an
automated task rather than a manual one as that will not only be faster,
but will reduce the opportunity for error.</p>

    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
