Computational thinking is an essential prerequisite for anyone wanting to learn to program computers and write code. 
This workshop will take you through the steps to develop a computational mindset. This lesson was initially conceived and designed by 
[Belinda Weaver](https://github.com/weaverbel) and you can find her orcid [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6156-7997).

## Learning Objectives

Once you have completed this workshop, you should be able to:

- Identify the steps involved in computational thinking
- Break a problem down into more manageable parts
- Develop a series of steps (an *algorithm*) to solve the problem
- Generalise the steps to make the algorithm re-usable (*abstraction*)
